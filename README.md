# Automatic Electricity Management System Using IoT⚡
Efficiency, Control, and Sustainability in the Modern World.

## Introduction


Modern society places a high priority on the effective use of power. In this context,
my research intends to address the problem of energy waste by presenting a
cutting-edge lighting management solution. I suggest an "Electricity Management
System" that makes use of automation and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to
intelligently and economically control the lighting. This system will minimise wasteful
energy consumption by automatically detecting the presence of people in a space
and adjusting the lights accordingly.
